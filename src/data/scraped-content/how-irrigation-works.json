It is a far safer and more effective water method of ear cleaning. It uses an electronic ear\n    irrigation machine to remove ear wax. The machine contains a storage reservoir unit for water and a hand-held nozzle which gently pumps water into the ear canal at a controlled and steady rate.\n    The water breaks down and dislodges the ear wax build-up, it then flushes the ear wax out of the canal and it is captured in a flask called a noots tank or ear cup. Not everyone is suitable for\n    earwax removal by irrigation&nbsp;and not all of our clinics offer irrigation ear wax removal, however they all offer you microsuction earwax removal.\n</p></div></div>    </div>\n    \n\n\n<br>\n\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><p>\n    Please note that ear irrigation is not appropriate if you have:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>A perforated eardrum, or if you have had a perforation in the last 12 months.\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Previously had problems with irrigation, such as pain in your ear or severe vertigo.\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Have a discharge of mucus from your ear or have had an ear infection in the preceding two months.\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Have recurring or persistent infections of the ear canal.\n    </li>\n\n    <li>You have had any ear surgery (apart from cases of extruded grommets which had come out at least 18 months beforehand) had a middle ear infection (otitis media) in the past six weeks.\n    </li>\n</ul></div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><h3 class=\"\">Pain-Free and Quick: Irrigation is totally comfortable and in most cases, the ear wax blockage is removed in minutes</h3></div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><div>\n    <a data-action=\"button\" href=\"/earwax-clinic-locations/\" data-title=\"Find your local clinic\">\n        Find your local clinic    </a>\n</div>\n</div><div>    <hr>\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><p>\n    Most of our clinics&nbsp;offer the irrigation method of earwax removal for people who are more comfortable with it and for situations that require it. The procedure is undertaken with a spray\n    type ear wash machine or hand held manual spray wash bottle, which is commonly used in the medical setting. The irrigation solution is carefully warmed to body temperature for comfort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Ear irrigation involves using a pressurised flow of water to remove the build-up of ear wax. This is a straightforward procedure where a controlled flow of water, at body temperature, is squirted\n    into the ear through a purpose-made machine (an electronic ear irrigator) or spray wash bottle. To ensure that the ear cannot be damaged, the electronic irrigator has a variable pressure control\n    so that irrigation can begin at the lowest pressure.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Under the gentle force of the water, the ear wax is softened and dislodged and the wax is carried out of the ear. This is why the term ‘irrigation’ is used, as opposed to ‘syringing’ which is a\n    different and outdated method by which the ear wax was literally ‘syringed’ from the ear using a metal syringe. Whilst irrigating your ear, the ear care specialist treating you may hold your ear\n    at different angles to ensure the water reaches all of your ear canal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    The&nbsp;specialist&nbsp;may also look inside your ear several times using an otoscope (an instrument used to examine the inside of your ear) to check whether the wax is coming out. Ear\n    irrigation is a painless procedure, but your ear may feel a little strange as the water is squirted around your ear canal.\n</p></div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div>    <hr>\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><h2 class=\"\">The Benefits of Our Irrigation Ear Cleaning</h2></div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><p>\n    Using our services ensures that you have your earwax removed safely, quickly and by a person you can trust.
