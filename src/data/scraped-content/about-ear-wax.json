As we delved into the world of ear care, we discovered that\n    many traditional methods for ear wax removal, like <a href=\"/do-ear-candles-work/\">ear candling</a>, were not only ineffective but potentially harmful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    After extensive research, we decided to focus on offering safer and more effective treatments like microsuction and irrigation. Our commitment to excellence and passion for helping people led to\n    the establishment of the Ear Wax Clinic, which now has multiple partners and&nbsp;<a href=\"/earwax-clinic-locations/\">locations</a> across the UK.\n</p></div><div id=\"cc-m-8359594756\" class=\"j-module n j-spacing \">\n    <div class=\"cc-m-spacer\" style=\"height: 50px;\">\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div id=\"cc-m-8359594556\" class=\"j-module n j-spacing \">\n    <div class=\"cc-m-spacer\" style=\"height: 50px;\">\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div id=\"cc-m-8359594956\" class=\"j-module n j-header \"><h2 class=\"\" id=\"cc-m-header-8359594956\">Our Expertise: Microsuction, Irrigation, and Home Ear Wax Removal Solutions</h2></div><div id=\"cc-m-8359595056\" class=\"j-module n j-spacing \">\n    <div class=\"cc-m-spacer\" style=\"height: 20px;\">\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div id=\"cc-m-8359595156\" class=\"j-module n j-text \"><p>\n    We understand that each person's ear care needs are unique.

  "textContent": "About Us - The Ear Wax Clinic: Your Trusted Ear Wax Removal Specialists\n    \n    \n\n\nOur Journey to Becoming the UK's Premier Ear Wax Removal Experts\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    At the Ear Wax Clinic, we pride ourselves on being the leading ear wax removal specialists in the UK. We are dedicated to providing professional, safe, and\n    effective solutions for people suffering from ear wax buildup. Our team of highly skilled audiologists and ear wax removal technicians have years of experience in the field, ensuring you receive\n    the best possible care for your ears.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Find your local clinic & Prices    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nHow It All Began\n    Our journey began with a simple goal: to help people find relief from the discomfort and hearing issues caused by ear wax build-up. As we delved into the world of ear care, we discovered that\n    many traditional methods for ear wax removal, like ear candling, were not only ineffective but potentially harmful.\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n    After extensive research, we decided to focus on offering safer and more effective treatments like microsuction and irrigation. Our commitment to excellence and passion for helping people led to\n    the establishment of the Ear Wax Clinic, which now has multiple partners and locations across the UK.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nOur Expertise: Microsuction, Irrigation, and Home Ear Wax Removal Solutions\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    We understand that each person's ear care needs are unique. That's why we offer a variety of treatments to address different types and degrees of ear wax buildup.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nMicrosuction: The Gold Standard in Ear Wax Removal\n    Microsuction is a safe and gentle method of removing ear wax. It involves using a tiny vacuum-like device to suction out the ear wax, without the need for water or any other liquids. To learn\n    more about how microsuction works, check out our How Microsuction Works page.\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n    We are also proud to offer professional microsuction training for audiologists and healthcare professionals who want to expand\n    their skillset and provide this essential service to their patients. Learn more about our microsuction training opportunities.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nIrrigation: A Tried and Tested Method for Ear Wax Removal\n    Another popular treatment we provide is ear irrigation, which involves using a controlled flow of water to flush out the ear wax. This method is safe and effective for most people, and you can\n    learn more about it on our How Irrigation Works page.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nHome Ear Wax Removal Solutions: When You Can't Make It to the Clinic\n    We understand that sometimes it's not possible to visit one of our clinics, so we also offer home ear wax removal solutions. Our Ultimate Home Ear Wax Removal Guide provides comprehensive information on how to safely remove ear wax at home.\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n    If you're considering a home syringe kit, it's essential to understand the differences between using a kit and seeking professional care. Visit our Home Syringe Kit vs. Professional Care page to learn more.\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n    For additional information on ear wax removal, take a look at our Ear Wax Removal Syringe Kit FAQ and our Ear Wax\n    FAQ pages.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nWhat Our Clients Have to Say\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    We take great pride in the positive feedback we receive from our clients. Visit our Testimonials page to read about their experiences with our\n    services and the life-changing results they've achieved.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nOur Commitment to You\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    At the Ear Wax Clinic, we are dedicated to providing the highest quality of care, using the latest technology and techniques. We continuously inform our partner's of the latest education and\n    training events and equipment to ensure that you receive the best treatment possible.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nUnderstanding Ear Wax and Its Importance\n    Ear wax, also known as cerumen, is a natural substance produced by your body to protect, clean, and lubricate your ears. While it might not be the most pleasant topic, understanding about ear wax is essential for maintaining healthy ears.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nTailored Treatments for Each Individual\n    We understand that every person's ears are different, and we take the time to assess your specific needs before recommending the best course of action. Our audiologists and ear wax removal\n    technicians work closely with you to develop a personalised treatment plan, ensuring your comfort and satisfaction.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nA Focus on Education and Prevention\n    In addition to offering treatment, we believe in educating our clients about proper ear care and preventive measures. Our partners are always happy to answer your questions and provide\n    guidance on how to keep your ears healthy and free of wax build-up.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nJoin Us in the Journey to Better Ear Health\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    We invite you to visit one of our Ear Wax Clinic locations and experience the difference that our expert care can make. Say goodbye to discomfort and\n    hearing issues caused by ear wax buildup and start your journey to better ear health today.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        What is it, why do we have it in our ears and why it sometimes causes hearing loss.\n    \n\n\n\n\n// <![CDATA[\n\n    window.regModule(\"module_imageSubtitle\", {\"data\":{\"imageExists\":true,\"hyperlink\":\"\",\"hyperlink_target\":\"\",\"hyperlinkAsString\":\"\",\"pinterest\":\"0\",\"id\":7987340856,\"widthEqualsContent\":\"1\",\"resizeWidth\":\"454\",\"resizeHeight\":735},\"id\":7987340856});\n// ]]>\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n            \n        \n        \n    Earwax, also known as cerumen, is produced inside your ears to keep them clean and free of germs. It usually passes out of the ears harmlessly, but sometimes too much can build up and block the\n    ears.\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n    It protects the skin of the human ear canal, assists in cleaning and lubrication, and also provides some protection from bacteria, fungi, insects and water. In other words, ear wax is a good\n    thing!\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n    The amount of ear wax that the body produces differs from person to person, the amount that is retained within the ear also differs for each of us - these differences are for a number of reasons:\n\n\n\n    Age\n    \n\n    Diet\n    \n\n    Lifestyle\n    \n\n    Personal anatomy\n    \n\n    Genetics\n    \n\n    Ethnicity\n    \n\n\n\n    Many people will produce a small amount of wax their whole lives, which leaves the ear canal naturally, and never have any problem with it. For others, their ear will produce a larger amount of\n    wax, which will not fully leave the ear canal and will become blocked, which leads to them having reduced hearing ability and also a blocked feeling in the ear.\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Find out more about earwax    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    Our micro suction and irrigation treatments help those who have excessive ear wax that is causing a blockage and resulting in a hearing loss or unpleasant feeling in the ear.\n\n    \n        Find your local clinic    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n// <![CDATA[\n\n    window.regModule(\"module_imageSubtitle\", {\"data\":{\"imageExists\":true,\"hyperlink\":\"http:\\/\\/page-1398943856\\/\",\"hyperlink_target\":\"\",\"hyperlinkAsString\":\"\",\"pinterest\":\"0\",\"id\":7987474756,\"widthEqualsContent\":\"1\",\"resizeWidth\":\"940\",\"resizeHeight\":492},\"id\":7987474756});\n// ]]>\n\n    \n    \n\n\nThe Benefits of Microsuction Earwax Removal\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        Ear Microsuction is Completely Safe\n    Earwax Removal by microsuction is the safest possible way to do it, because the professional can always see what they are doing.\n    \n            \n        \n        Ear Microsuction is Usually Very Quick\n    Microsuction earwax removal is the quickest process for ear cleaning, usually lasting no longer than twenty minutes.\n    \n            \n        \n        Ear Microsuction Has a Low Infection Risk\n    Micro suction is a completely dry and sterile procedure and therefore has a much lower infection risk than any water methods\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\nThe benefits of Irrigation Earwax Removal\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        Ear Irrigation is Completely Safe\n    Earwax Removal by irrigation is a very safe method of ear cleaning.

It usually passes out of the ears harmlessly, but sometimes too much can build up and block the\n    ears.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    It protects the skin of the human ear canal, assists in cleaning and lubrication, and also provides some protection from bacteria, fungi, insects and water. In other words, ear wax is a good\n    thing!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    The amount of ear wax that the body produces differs from person to person, the amount that is retained within the ear also differs for each of us - these differences are for a number of reasons:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Age\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Diet\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Lifestyle\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Personal anatomy\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Genetics\n    </li>\n\n    <li>Ethnicity\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n    Many people will produce a small amount of wax their whole lives, which leaves the ear canal naturally, and never have any problem with it. For others, their ear will produce a larger amount of\n    wax, which will not fully leave the ear canal and will become blocked, which leads to them having reduced hearing ability and also a blocked feeling in the ear.\n</p></div></div>    </div>\n    \n\n\n<br>\n\n</div><div><div>\n    <a data-action=\"button\" href=\"/comprehensive-earwax-information/\" data-title=\"Find out more about earwax\">\n        Find out more about earwax    </a>\n</div>\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><p>\n    Our&nbsp;<a href=\"/how-microsuction-works/\" title=\"Ear Microsuction\" class=\"\">micro suction</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"/how-irrigation-works/\" title=\"Ear Irrigation\" class=\"\">irrigation</a>&nbsp;treatments help those who have excessive ear wax that is causing a blockage and resulting in a hearing loss or unpleasant feeling in the ear.\n</p></div><div><div>\n    <a data-action=\"button\" href=\"/earwax-clinic-locations/\" data-title=\"Find your local clinic\">\n        Find your local clinic    </a>\n</div>\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><figure>\n<img srcset=\"https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=320x10000:format=png/path/s7be4434f63c79658/image/ia5cc622c18cd1166/version/1569218267/same-day-ear-wax-removal-appointments.png 320w, https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=640x10000:format=png/path/s7be4434f63c79658/image/ia5cc622c18cd1166/version/1569218267/same-day-ear-wax-removal-appointments.png 640w, https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=940x10000:format=png/path/s7be4434f63c79658/image/ia5cc622c18cd1166/version/1569218267/same-day-ear-wax-removal-appointments.png 940w, https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=960x10000:format=png/path/s7be4434f63c79658/image/ia5cc622c18cd1166/version/1569218267/same-day-ear-wax-removal-appointments.png 960w, https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s7be4434f63c79658/image/ia5cc622c18cd1166/version/1569218267/same-day-ear-wax-removal-appointments.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 940px) 940px, 100vw\" src=\"https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=940x10000:format=png/path/s7be4434f63c79658/image/ia5cc622c18cd1166/version/1569218267/same-day-ear-wax-removal-appointments.png\" alt=\"same day ear wax removal appointments\" class=\"\" data-src-width=\"1200\" data-src-height=\"628\" data-src=\"https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=940x10000:format=png/path/s7be4434f63c79658/image/ia5cc622c18cd1166/version/1569218267/same-day-ear-wax-removal-appointments.png\" data-image-id=\"5095195556\">    \n\n</figure>\n\n\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><h2 class=\"\">The Benefits of Microsuction Earwax Removal</h2></div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div>    <div>\n        <div><div><h3 class=\"\">Ear Microsuction is Completely Safe</h3></div><div><p>\n    Earwax Removal by microsuction is the safest possible way to do it, because the professional can always see what they are doing.\n</p></div></div>    </div>\n            <div data-display=\"cms-only\"></div>\n        <div>\n        <div><div><h3 class=\"\">Ear Microsuction is Usually Very Quick</h3></div><div><p>\n    Microsuction earwax removal is the quickest process for ear cleaning, usually lasting no longer than twenty minutes.\n</p></div></div>    </div>\n            <div data-display=\"cms-only\"></div>\n        <div>\n        <div><div><h3 class=\"\">Ear Microsuction Has a Low Infection Risk</h3></div><div><p>\n    Micro suction is a completely dry and sterile procedure and therefore has a much lower infection risk than any water methods\n</p></div></div>    </div>\n    \n\n\n<br>\n\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div>    <hr>\n</div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div><h2 class=\"\">The benefits of Irrigation Earwax Removal</h2></div><div>\n    <div>\n    \n</div>\n\n</div><div>    <div>\n        <div><div><h3 class=\"\">Ear Irrigation is Completely Safe</h3></div><div><p>\n    Earwax Removal by irrigation is a very safe method of ear cleaning.
