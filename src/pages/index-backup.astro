          Many people are discovering that their local NHS medical centre no longer provides ear syringing, also known as ear irrigation, or has long waiting times. This is undoubtedly due to a
          lack of funding, but the fact that ear syringing is inherently less safe than ear microsuction has also played a role. Many people have been injured as a result of the ear syringing procedure,
          which is why we try not to provide it as a service unless it is absolutely appropriate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ear infection, hearing loss, tinnitus, perforation of the ear drum, and further impaction of the ear wax are all possible side effects of ear syringing or irrigation, i.e., the ear wax gets
          pushed even harder against the ear drum. Is it any surprise that people are avoiding walk-in ear syringing in favour of microsuction ear wax removal?
        </p>

        <p>
          "Going private" is now far less expensive than it was, with many hearing centres now offering it as a service. Our patients have repeatedly told us that the money they paid was well worth it
          for the relief of finally being able to hear properly without waiting for an NHS appointment. Why not bypass the line by "going private"?

          will do that as soon as we get back from hols. Thank you I can hear again.

          Chose this clinic because my doctors no longer offer this service, my nearest clinic on NHS was Whitegate Drive. This clinic was 5 mins from my home. My impression of this clinic was very
          professional man, will use again. Thank you."

          <h3>Ear Microsuction Specialists</h3>
          <p>
            We specialise in the microsuction ear wax removal technique for removing ear blockages. This is generally accepted to be the safest and most effective method of ear wax removal, and it is
            completely syringe free with no need for weeks of softening with oil. The procedure commonly takes a few minutes for each ear. In some rare cases, ear syringing can still be effective, and some
            of our audiologists may still recommend and use this procedure where appropriate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Local & Professional</h3>
          <p>
            Carried out at one of our many convenient ear wax clinics or in your home, we charge from £40 for one ear and £60 for both ears (unless otherwise stated on the Ear Wax Clinic Locations
            page). Some ear wax removal clinics are able to make emergency evening and weekend appointments. A few ear wax removal specialists also offer home visits for an
            additional fee. There will be a video otoscopic examination before and after the procedure to show you the results. If the problem isn't a blocked ear, then a hearing test may be carried out
            and/or referral advice may be given, charged at the normal appointment rate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Registered & Insured</h3>
          <p>
            Safety is paramount, and the ear wax removal procedure should always be comfortable and pain-free. We carefully select fully qualified and registered experienced ear care professionals who are
            also trained to The Hearing Lab's standards as well as their registering body's standards. If they have not been trained by The Hearing Lab, this is because they have been previously trained by
            another Hearing Lab-recognised training provider. We have also worked closely with insurance providers to make sure our practitioners and their patients are fully covered.
