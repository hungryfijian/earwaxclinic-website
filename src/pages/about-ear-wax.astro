            <h3>Your Ears Are Actually Trying to Help</h3>
            <p>That waxy substance? It's called cerumen, and it's your ear's natural cleaning and protection system. Think of it as your ear's personal bodyguard, keeping dust, bacteria, and debris from reaching your delicate inner ear.</p>

            <h3>Usually, Your Ears Self-Clean</h3>
            <p>Normally, old wax naturally moves outward while you talk, chew, and move your jaw. It's an amazing automatic system that most people never even notice working.</p>
            <div class="what-went-wrong">But sometimes this system gets overwhelmed...</div>

            <p>Various factors can disrupt this natural process, causing wax to build up instead of clearing out. When this happens, you get those frustrating symptoms you're experiencing right now.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Why Is This Happening to Me?</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">You're probably wondering why your ears aren't self-cleaning like they should. Here are the most common reasons:</p>

        <div class="causes-grid">
          <div class="cause-card">
            <div class="cause-icon">🧬</div>
            <h3>It's Not Your Fault - It's Often Genetic</h3>
            <p>Some people simply produce more wax than others. If your parents had ear wax issues, you're more likely to as well. Your ear canal shape and size are inherited too.</p>
            <div class="comfort-note">✓ This affects millions of people</div>
          </div>

          <div class="cause-card">
            <div class="cause-icon">🎧</div>
            <h3>Modern Life Doesn't Help</h3>
            <p>Headphones, earbuds, hearing aids, or earplugs can push wax deeper and prevent natural cleaning. If you use any of these regularly, buildup is almost inevitable.</p>
            <div class="comfort-note">✓ Very common in today's world</div>
          </div>

          <div class="cause-card">
            <div class="cause-icon">🪃</div>
            <h3>Cotton Buds Made It Worse</h3>
            <p>We've all done it - tried to clean our ears with cotton buds. Unfortunately, this usually pushes wax deeper and compacts it against your eardrum, making the problem much worse.</p>
            <div class="comfort-note">✓ Almost everyone has done this</div>
          </div>

          <div class="cause-card">
            <div class="cause-icon">🕰️</div>
            <h3>Age Changes Everything</h3>
            <p>As we get older, our wax becomes drier and harder. The natural cleaning process becomes less effective, and ear hair increases, trapping wax that should move out.</p>
            <div class="comfort-note">✓ Natural part of aging</div>
          </div>

          <div class="cause-card">
            <div class="cause-icon">🏗️</div>
            <h3>Your Job Environment</h3>
            <p>Work in dusty, dirty, or loud environments? Your ears produce extra wax to protect themselves, but this can sometimes backfire and create blockages.</p>
            <div class="comfort-note">✓ Your ears are working overtime</div>
          </div>

          <div class="cause-card">
            <div class="cause-icon">🔬</div>
            <h3>Skin Conditions</h3>
            <p>Eczema, psoriasis, or other skin conditions can affect wax production and consistency, making blockages more likely even with normal cleaning.</p>
            <div class="comfort-note">✓ Medical condition, not neglect</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="permission-box">
          <h3>Stop Blaming Yourself</h3>
          <p>Ear wax buildup isn't about being dirty or not cleaning properly. It's usually a combination of factors beyond your control. The important thing now is getting the relief you deserve.</p>
